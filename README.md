# Fault tracking frameworks for RISC-V Architecture
 RISC-V is a simple but reliable open instruction set architecture that supports multiple platforms. Â The software support for RISC-V has been increasing in the past few years. However, there is a large room in developing a fault-tracking framework for it. In this project, students are expected to design fault injection and tracking framework for reliability analysis of open-source hardware based on RISC-V. Students will work with FPGAs in implementing the RISC-V instruction set and they are tasked with developing a software tool for fault injection and tracking.
